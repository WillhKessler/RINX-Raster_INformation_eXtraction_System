# RINX-Raster_INformation_eXtraction_System
RINX (Raster INformation eXtraction) is an end-to-end solution for automatic extraction of information from large rasters datasets. RINX heavily utilises open source geospatial techniques for information extraction. It also complements the traditional approaches with state-of-the-art high-performance computing techniques. The input for RINX is a set of rasters from which the information has to be extracted and a set of data point locations for which the information needs to be extracted. The output for RINX is a structured representation of extracted information from the raster datasets for each data point in CSV text format. The loading and pre-processing of the input datasets to RINX is accomplished using a combination of Bash and SQL scripting techniques for automation. This pre-processed input is then fed into the open source spatial database PostGIS to extract the required information by using multiple spatial techniques. Finally, the extracted output is post-processed for deduplication  and  standardisation of extracted information for research use. RINX is designed in a way that makes it easy to deploy and scale on any local, cloud, or  cluster computing platform.
